    <div class="explanation">
        <h2>Rankings System Explanation</h2>
        <p><strong>Account ID Points:</strong></p>
        <p>The account ID is obtained from accountDetails['Account_id'].</p>
        <p>If the account ID is between 1 and 16,000 (inclusive), 10 points are added to the rank.</p>
        <p>If the account ID is between 16,001 and 25,000 (inclusive), 7 points are added to the rank.</p>
        <p>If the account ID is between 25,001 and 100,000 (inclusive), 5 points are added to the rank.</p>
        <p>If the account ID is between 100,001 and 10,000,000 (inclusive), 1 point is added to the rank.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Username Points:</strong></p>
        <p>The username is obtained from accountDetails.Username.</p>
        <p>If the username contains at least one alphabetic character (a-zA-Z), 15 points are added to the rank. This indicates an alphabetic username.</p>
        <p>If the username consists only of numeric characters, 15 points are added to the rank. This indicates a numeric username.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Additional Points based on Username Length:</strong></p>
        <p>Points are added or subtracted based on the length of the username. The formula (6 - usernameLength) * 10 is used, where usernameLength represents the length of the username. For example, if the username is 3 characters long, 30 points will be added to the rank ((6 - 3) * 10 = 30).</p>
      
        <p><strong>The rank text and points are determined as follows:</strong></p>
        <p>If the rank is 50 or higher, the rank text is "Legendary" with 50 points.</p>
        <p>If the rank is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), the rank text is "Epic" with 40 points.</p>
        <p>If the rank is between 30 and 39 (inclusive), the rank text is "Rare" with 30 points.</p>
        <p>If the rank is between 25 and 29 (inclusive), the rank text is "Uncommon" with 25 points.</p>
        <p>If the rank is between 15 and 24 (inclusive), the rank text is "Common" with 15 points.</p>
        <p>If the rank is less than 15, the rank text is "Basic" with 10 points.</p>
      
        <p><strong>The associated rank color is determined as follows:</strong></p>
        <p>"Legendary" rank is represented by the color red.</p>
        <p>"Epic" rank is represented by the color purple.</p>
        <p>"Rare" rank is represented by the color blue.</p>
        <p>"Uncommon" rank is represented by the color green.</p>
        <p>"Common" rank is represented by the color orange.</p>
        <p>"Basic" rank is represented by the color gray.</p>
